change data dir to its own dir instead of using firmware-tools dir

figure out p7zip rpm, will it be the same on each os?

try to unzip all dirs, then check if anything came out with all the globs, instead of looping

instead of bad pie, raise common.skip and log the error

getoutputdir is kinda long
